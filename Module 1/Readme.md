This folder contain the ER diagram and the SQL later generated while using forward.
   ER diagram is in:
    ```little_lemon_db.mwb```
    ```little_lemon_db.png```
    SQL is in:
     ```little_lemon_db_sql.sql```

The image can be used to understand the ER I used, I also modified, as required, the main example so as to better suit it to my needs and to better conform to normalization requirement. The SQL can be used to generate the database. Before populating it with data.
